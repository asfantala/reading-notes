# Data_Structures and Algorithms
### why this topic matters
Data structures are being used in almost every program or software system that has been developed
### What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
Efficiency of the data structure for the problem at hand. This involves considering factors such as the time complexity of the operations that will be performed on the data structure, the size of the data set, and any constraints that may apply

### How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
setting up a condition that is met when the function should stop calling itself and return a result
