# Django Custom User


### What are the key benefits of using a Django Custom User Model, and how does it differ from the default Django User Model?

- Flexibility: A Custom User Model allows you to define the fields and behaviors that are relevant to your application. You can add additional fields or remove unnecessary ones, ensuring that the user model aligns with your project's requirements.
- Scalability: With a Custom User Model, you have the freedom to extend and modify the user model without impacting the default Django User Model. This makes it easier to adapt the user model to changing business needs and accommodate future feature enhancements.
- Enhanced Security: By implementing a Custom User Model, you can implement unique authentication methods or additional security measures that are specific to your application. This provides better control over user authentication and safeguards user data.
- Avoiding Dependencies: the default Django User Model might not have the necessary fields or attributes for your application. By using a Custom User Model, you can avoid dependencies on the default user model and have complete control over the user representation in your project.
### Explain the process of creating and implementing a Custom User Model in Django, including the necessary changes to settings.py and the required model fields.
- Process of creating and implementing a Custom User Model in Django:
Creating and implementing a Custom User Model involves the following steps:

1. Create a new Django app to contain your custom user model, such as an "accounts" app.
2. Define your custom user model in the app's models.py file. Extend the AbstractBaseUser and PermissionsMixin classes, and customize the fields and methods based on your project's requirements.
3. Override the USERNAME_FIELD attribute to specify the unique identifier for the user, such as an email or username.
4. Create a custom manager class for the custom user model, handling user creation and retrieval.
5. Update the AUTH_USER_MODEL setting in the project's settings.py file to reference your custom user model, using the format 'app_name.ModelName'.
6. Generate and apply database migrations to create the necessary tables for the custom user model using the command python manage.py makemigrations and python manage.py migrate.
7. Update any parts of your project that rely on the default user model, such as authentication views, forms, and templates, to use your custom user model.
