# Ethics 

## Ethics in the workplace
1. The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of
- I agree with the author that developers have a responsibility to consider the ethical implications of their code. As software becomes more and more pervasive in our lives, it is important that we ensure that our code is used for good and not for harm,  if we are aware of the ethical implications of our code, other people may not be. It is important to be vocal about our concerns and to stand up for what we believe is right.


## Ethics in Technology
1. Self Driving Car Ethics
- I agree with , I think that it is important to consider the law when programming self-driving cars. In some countries, it is illegal to program a car to kill a human being, even if it means saving the lives of other people. This is something that will need to be taken into account when making decisions about how to program self-driving cars.
