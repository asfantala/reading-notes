# Linear Regressions

### Can you explain the basic concept of linear regression and its purpose in the context of machine learning and data analysis?
- Linear regression is a statistical modeling technique used to establish a linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It aims to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.

### Describe the process of implementing a linear regression model using Python’s Scikit Learn library, including the necessary steps and functions.

- Import the packages and classes that you need : libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
- Provide data to work with, and eventually do appropriate transformations.
- Create a regression model and fit it with existing data: Instantiate a linear regression model object from the LinearRegression class in Scikit-Learn. Fit the model to the training data using the fit function
- Check the results of model fitting to know whether the model is satisfactory.
- Apply the model for predictions: using the predict function.

### What is the purpose of splitting the dataset into train and test sets, and how does this contribute to the evaluation of a machine learning model’s performance?
The purpose of this split is to assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data. The train set is used to train the model, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships in the data. The test set, which the model has not seen during training, is then used to evaluate its performance. By comparing the model's predictions on the test set with the actual values, we can measure the model's accuracy and assess its ability to generalize.
