### In the context of ES6 Syntax and Feature Overview, what are three key features introduced in ES6 that improve upon the previous version of JavaScript, and briefly explain their benefits?
- Let and const keywords: These keywords allow for block-scoped variables, which means that their scope is limited to the block in which they are declared. This makes code more readable and easier to debug.
- Arrow functions: Arrow functions are a new type of function that are more concise and easier to read than traditional functions. They also have some unique features, such as the ability to capture the value of their surrounding scope by default.
- Template literals: Template literals are a new way to create strings that allow for interpolation of expressions and variables. This makes code more readable and easier to maintain.
### After reading “Tailwind in 15 minutes,” can you describe the purpose of utility classes in Tailwind CSS and provide an example of how to use them to style an HTML element?
- Layout: Utility classes can be used to position elements, set their width and height, and add margins and padding.
- Typography: Utility classes can be used to set the font family, font size, and color of text.
- Colors: Utility classes can be used to set the background color, text color, and border color of an element.
- Effects: Utility classes can be used to add box shadows, borders, and other effects to an element

### Based on “Why to use Next.js,” explain the main advantages of using Next.js for web development, and provide a brief comparison between traditional client-side rendering and Next.js’s server-side rendering approach.
- Performance: Next.js uses server-side rendering (SSR) to pre-render the initial HTML of your pages on the server. This means that the first time a user visits your page, they will see the rendered HTML immediately, without having to wait for the JavaScript to load. This can significantly improve the perceived performance of your pages.
- SEO: Next.js also supports server-side rendering, which can help to improve your SEO. This is because search engines can index the rendered HTML of your pages, which can help your pages to rank higher in search results.
- Development: Next.js provides a number of features that can make development easier, such as automatic code splitting, routing, and image optimization. These features can help you to build more efficient and scalable applications.
- Scalability: Next.js is designed to be scalable, so you can easily scale your applications as your traffic grows.
