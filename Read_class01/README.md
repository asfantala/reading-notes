# Pain and Suffering

**The main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python that they will learn far more than most people learn in 2 years of study in a University setting about software development and over all so it will be kinda heavy on them and theyâ€™ll feel exhausted all while being filled with information day after day**


### Two strategies for overcoming obstacles:
1- Learn to Ask for Help and Work in Team it is the fastest and easiest way to gain the skills you need to have for a successful code

2- Check out Helpful Online Coding Resources

## Big O

Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

**Time complexity** : It measures the number of operations an algorithm performs as the input grows

**Space complexity** : It measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as the input grows

* for example :  
O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set

## The difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python

* Mutable	 object can be changed after it is created , more than one name ,all name see the change.

* Immutable value cannot be changed in place
