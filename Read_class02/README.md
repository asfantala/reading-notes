# Testing and Modules 

### the key principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python and how do they contribute to the overall quality of code?
Test-Driven Development is a strategy to think tests first, to write a failing test, Write the feature and make the test pass and then Refactor the code to improve its quality and make the code more reliable, then reapet the process because it's a cycle.


------
### The purpose of the if __name__ == '__main__':
when the interpreter runs a module, the __name__ variable will be set as  __main__ if the module that is being run is the main program, it implies that the module is being run standalone by the user and we can do corresponding appropriate actions.

But if the code is importing the module from another module, then the __name__  variable will be set to that moduleâ€™s name

### The concept of recursion in Python

means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result
 
-----
### The difference between Python modules and packages

modules are individual files containing code, while packages are directories containing one or more modules
